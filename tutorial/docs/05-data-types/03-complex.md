# complex (complex number)
```python
variable_complex_number1 = 5j # Its real part is 0 and its imaginary part is 5j
variable_complex_number2 = 2+3j # Its real part is 2 and its imaginary part is 3j
variable_complex_number3 = 3j+2 # Its real part is 2 and its imaginary part is 3j
variable_complex_number4 = 3j+2.5 # Its real part is 2.5 and its imaginary part is 3j
``` 
- numerical type
- Appending 'j' or 'J' to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part).
    - It can be added to an integer or float to get a complex number with real part different from zero.
