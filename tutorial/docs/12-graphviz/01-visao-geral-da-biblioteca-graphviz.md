# Vis√£o geral da Biblioteca Graphviz
- Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. 
- Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
- The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.
