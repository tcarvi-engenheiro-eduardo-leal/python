# bytearray
- bytearray objects are a mutable counterpart to bytes objects.
- There is no dedicated literal syntax for bytearray objects, instead they are always created by calling the constructor:
- class bytearray([source[, encoding[, errors]]])
    - Creating an empty instance:
        - `bytearray-variable_name0 = bytearray()`
    - Creating a zero-filled instance with a given length: 
        - `bytearray-variable_name1 = bytearray(10)`
    - From an iterable of integers: 
        - `bytearray-variable_name2 = bytearray(range(20))`
    - Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol:
        - `bytearray-variable_name3 = bytearray(b'Hi!')`
    - As bytearray objects are mutable, they support the mutable sequence operations in addition to the common bytes and bytearray operations described in Bytes and Bytearray Operations.
